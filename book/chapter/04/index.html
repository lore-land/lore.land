    <h1>Chapter 04: Boof and the Fool’s Mirror</h1>

    <custom-boof>
        <p>
            Boof stumbled upon the <custom-mirror>Fool’s Mirror</custom-mirror>, a reflective surface that showed not just a reflection, but a world inverted, where the familiar became strange.
        </p>
    </custom-boof>

    <custom-mirror>
        <p data-content_id="mirror-intro">
            The Fool’s Mirror shimmered, revealing truths that danced between reflection and distortion. It whispered, "What you see is not what is, but what you believe."
        </p>
    </custom-mirror>

    <custom-fool>
        <p>
            "Look into the mirror, Boof," the Fool’s voice echoed. "In it, you will see not me, but yourself. And in yourself, you will find what you seek."
        </p>
    </custom-fool>

        <h2>The Reflections of the Fool’s Mirror</h2>
        <p>
            As Boof gazed into the mirror, their reflection shifted. It became both them and not them, a version that was twisted by perception, altered by the gaze of the Fool.
            The boonberries glowed faintly in the reflection, yet they did not exist in the world outside the glass.
        </p>
    </section>

    <custom-boof>
        <p>
            Boof touched the mirror, and for a moment, felt their hand sink into its surface, as if reality had become liquid.
            "What is this?" Boof murmured. But the only answer was the Fool’s laughter, drifting like a breeze across the glass.
        </p>
