        <p>
            Boof's journey led them deeper into the <custom-boonberry>grove</custom-boonberry>, where every step seemed to stir the whispers of the past. The <custom-echo>echoes</custom-echo> lingered, repeating fragments of lost stories.
        </p>
    </custom-boof>

    <custom-boonberry>
        <p data-content_id="grove">
            "The Fool was here," the grove seemed to say, though no voice spoke it directly. The boonberries reflected strange patterns, hinting at the Fool’s games.
        </p>
    </custom-boonberry>

    <custom-echo>
        <p>
            "Follow me," the echo beckoned, though it was not clear if it belonged to the Fool, or something else entirely.
        </p>
    </custom-echo>

        <h2>The Echoes of the Grove</h2>
        <p>
            In the grove, time did not pass in a linear fashion. Boof felt as if they had already walked this path—yet it was new. The boonberries glowed brighter, as if the Fool's presence had just passed.
        </p>

    <custom-fool>
        <p>
            "Are you lost, Boof?" the Fool’s voice echoed, though it felt distant—almost playful. "Or perhaps, you’re right where you need to be."
        </p>
    </custom-fool>
